### The Docker Command Line Interface (CLI) is the primary tool for interacting with Docker. It allows users to execute commands to control Docker objects like containers, images, volumes, and
## Managing Docker Images Commands:

#### Create and start a container from an image.
```shell 
docker run nginx
````
#### Running the container in detached mode.
```shell 
docker run -d nginx
````

```text
Flag: -d (detached)
Purpose: Runs the container in the background.
Explanation: By default, docker run starts a container in the foreground, meaning it occupies your terminal window and displays the container's output there. The -d flag allows the container to run in the background, freeing up your terminal for other tasks.
```

#### Running the container in detached mode with port mapping.
```shell 
docker run -d -p 8080:80 nginx
````

```text
Flag: -p (port mapping)
Purpose: Mapping Ports for Container Communication.
Explanation: This flag is crucial for allowing applications running inside Docker containers to communicate with the outside world or other containers. It maps ports between the container's internal network and the host machine's network.
```

#### Running the container in Interactive mode.
```shell 
docker run -it nginx
````

```text
Flag: -i (interactive)
Purpose: Keeps the standard input (stdin) open even if not attached..
Explanation: This flag is often used in conjunction with -t to create an interactive container. However, -i by itself ensures that the container's standard input remains open, even if you don't attach to it initially. This allows you to later connect to the container and provide input using docker attach.
Use Case: Useful for containers that require user interaction at some point, such as running a shell or command-line tool within the container.
```
```text
Flag: -t (pseudo-TTY)
Purpose:  Allocates a pseudo-terminal (TTY) for the container.
Explanation: This flag creates a TTY device for the container, which makes it behave more like a standard terminal session. This is essential for interactive containers where you want to provide input and see output.
Use Case: Necessary for running interactive shells or applications within the container.
```
```text
Flag: -it (interactive) and (pseudo-TTY) combined
Purpose:   Creates an interactive container in the foreground.
Explanation: This is the most common combination for starting interactive containers. It opens the standard input (-i) and allocates a pseudo-TTY (-t), allowing you to interact with the container directly in your terminal.
Use Case: Essential for running shells, development environments, or any container where you need to provide user input.
```

#### Gracefully stop a running container.
```shell 
docker stop nginx
````


#### Forcefully stop a running container.
```shell 
docker kill nginx
````


#### Restart a stopped container.
```shell 
docker restart nginx
````


#### Handling Multiple Containers
```shell 
docker stop $(docker ps -q)
````

```text
Flag: -q (quiet mode) 
Purpose:  Lists container IDs in quiet mode (only container IDs).
Explanation:  The docker ps command by default displays information about running containers, including their ID, image, command, status, ports, and names. The -q flag (quiet) suppresses all this output and only prints the container IDs, one per line.
Use Case: Useful for scripting or automation purposes where you only need the container IDs to perform further actions with other Docker commands
```


#### Remove a stopped container :
```shell
docker rm nginx
```


#### Remove multiple containers at once :
```shell
docker rm $(docker ps -a -q)
```


#### Remove all stopped containers :
```shell
docker container prune
```


#### Inspecting Container Details :
```shell
docker inspect nginx
```


#### Checking Container Logs :
```shell
docker logs -f nginx
```

```text
Flag: -f (following)
Purpose: The -f flag (follow) instructs docker logs to continuously display the logs generated by a container as they occur.
Explanation:  The command will start printing any new logs produced by the container to your terminal.
It will continue displaying new logs indefinitely until you stop the process.
```


#### Monitoring Container Resource Usage : 
```shell
docker stats nginx
```
